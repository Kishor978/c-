// Write a program to compare two objects of a class that contains an integer value as
//  its data member. Make overloading functions to overload equality(==), less than(<),
//  greater than(>), not equal (!=), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or
//  equal to(<=) operators using member operator functions.
