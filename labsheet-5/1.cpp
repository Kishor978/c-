// Write a class for instantiating the objects that represent the two-dimensional Cartesian
//  coordinate system.
// A. Make a particular member function of one class as a friend function of another class
//  for addition.
// B. Make the other three functions to work as a bridge between the classes for
//  multiplication, division, and subtraction.
// C. Also write a small program to demonstrate that all the member functions of one class are
//  the friend functions of another class if the former class is made friend to the latter.
// Make least possible classes to demonstrate all the above in a single program without conflict.
